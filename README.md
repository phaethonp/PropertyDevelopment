# Direct Investment in property development

### The Limited Partnership
A limited partnership where the Limited Partners (LPs) are institutional investors such as Real Estate funds, AIF etc. The LPs will invest in a high-rise residential real estate development project managed by the General Partner (GP). 

# Investment objectives
### Purpose and Scope. 
* 1. Acquire land, design, and develop an iconic high-rise residential building spanning a height of 90-120 meters.
  2.  Deliver to LPs their proportionate share of apartments. They're free to sell or lease these based on their financial strategies.
  3. Cost-based rate: The LP's will receive their apartments at cost reflecting the actual cost of development. This rate is determined based on a combination of construction costs, regulatory fees, land acquisition costs, and a nominal markup for unforeseen expenses. 
  4. Achieve a targeted ROI OF 15%+ per annum compared to market prices of apartments. This ROI is calculated based on current market trends, expected appreciation, and rental yields.
  5. Enhance the potential for long term growth through a software platform for the sale and rental of apartments
  6. Enhance value by Deliver a building management platform enabling tenants to manage their building and service amenities

**Maximum Capped Cost:** The GP will establish a predetermined maximum budgeted cost per apartment. This cap ensures predictability for the LPs and demonstrates the GP's commitment to cost control and efficiency. Any residual funds post-completion will be proportionally returned to the LPs.

**GP Compensation:** Through a sweat equity stake in the project, the GP will retain 20% of the total apartment units as compensation. This percentage is in line with industry standards, considering the risks and responsibilities undertaken by the GP.

### Fair apartment split algorithm
* The apartment split among LPs is based on their proportionate investment in the project. An algorithm ensures that the split is equitable, considering factors like apartment size, floor level, and view orientation.

# Investment Strategies
To achieve its strategies, the Partnership will acquire land in city centers that fall under the building incentives scheme in the Republic of Cyprus. The building incentives scheme offers increased building density height terms and expedited approvals for developments in designated areas, promoting urban development.

### Offering Memorandum: 
The Private Placement Memorandum (PPM) outlines the fund's strategy, terms, risks, and other pertinent details. Interested parties can access the PPM via a dedicated link on our website.

### Pre-Closing Capital Commitments:
The General Partner (GP) will issue a "capital call" for a portion of the committed capital. Capital calls are expected to occur semi-annually, with an average amount equivalent to 17% of the committed capital.

### Expense Allocation:
* Organizational Expenses: These are costs associated with setting up the fund. Expected to be within 2-3% of the total fund size.
* Due Diligence and Pre-Investment Expenses: Costs related to market analysis, site visits, and initial due diligence. Estimated to be around 1-2% of the total fund size.

### Management Fee & Expense Reimbursement:
Management Fee: The GP usually charges an annual management fee. This fee is set at 2% of the committed or invested capital.
Expense Reimbursement: Some specific expenses might be directly reimbursed by the fund. Terms of such reimbursements are detailed in the fund's official documents.

**Expense Reimbursement:** Some specific expenses, especially those incurred during the pre-investment phase, might be directly reimbursed by the fund rather than being covered by the management fee. The terms of such reimbursements should be clearly outlined in the fund's documents.

### Transition to Investment Phase:
**Closing:** Once the preliminary activities are complete and the project is ready to proceed, the fund transitions to the "closing" or "investment" phase. At this point, additional capital is drawn from investors, and the project's active development begins.

**Return of Unused Capital:** If any of the drawn capital remains unused after the pre-investment activities, it can either be returned to investors or offset against future capital calls.
