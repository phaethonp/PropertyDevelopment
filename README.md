The fund structure allows for a pooling of capital from multiple investors (LPs) to finance a project, with the GP managing the project and being compensated for their expertise and the risks they take on with

# Fund Structure:
**Legal Structure:** Limited Partnership
**General Partner (GP):** The GP is the developer responsible for the day-to-day management of the fund, making investment decisions, and executing the project.
**Limited Partners (LPs):** Institutional external investors who provide the the capital but have limited liability and are not involved in the day-to-day management

### Partnership Structure

**Apartment Allocation:** After project completion, LPs will receive their designated apartments. They're free to sell or lease these based on their financial strategies.
**Sweat Equity Share:** Recognizing the efforts and risks involved, the GP will retain 20% of the apartments as sweat equity, ensuring our interests are aligned with the project's long-term success.

### Offering Memorandum: 
The Private Placement Memorandum (PPM) outlines the fund's strategy, terms, risks, and other pertinent details. It serves as the primary document for potential investors.

### Pre-Closing Capital Commitments:
Capital Call: The General Partner (GP), will issue a "capital call" for a portion of the committed capital. This is to cover preliminary expenses like market analysis, due diligence, and other pre-investment activities.

### Expense Allocation:
**Organizational Expenses:** These are costs associated with setting up the fund, such as legal fees, regulatory filings, and initial marketing. Typically, the fund covers these expenses, but there's often a cap or limit set in the PPM.

**Due Diligence and Pre-Investment Expenses:** Costs related to market analysis, site visits, initial due diligence, and other pre-investment activities are also typically borne by the fund. However, it's essential to specify in the fund's documents which expenses will be covered.

### Management Fee & Expense Reimbursement:
**Management Fee:** The GP usually charges an annual management fee, often a percentage of the committed or invested capital. This fee compensates the GP for managing the fund and can be used to cover some of the operational expenses.

**Expense Reimbursement:** Some specific expenses, especially those incurred during the pre-investment phase, might be directly reimbursed by the fund rather than being covered by the management fee. The terms of such reimbursements should be clearly outlined in the fund's documents.

### Transition to Investment Phase:
**Closing:** Once the preliminary activities are complete and the project is ready to proceed, the fund transitions to the "closing" or "investment" phase. At this point, additional capital is drawn from investors, and the project's active development begins.

**Return of Unused Capital:** If any of the drawn capital remains unused after the pre-investment activities, it can either be returned to investors or offset against future capital calls.


# Exit Strategy
The GP delivers fully operational apartments to the LP's and that concludes the obligations of the GP towards the LP's.



### Alignment of Interests: 
The GP's compensation is tied to the performance of the investment, aligning the GP's interests with those of the LPs.

Key Components of the Real Estate Private Equity Fund Structure:
Fund Management Fee: 0.5%
Sweat Equity: The GP will retain 20% of the apartments aligning his interests with the interests of the LP's.
