#### A new, simplified way to acquire 

### How It Works:
* Step 1: State Your Needs
"Prospective clients express their needs and preferences for office spaces and apartments through our platform, even before the purchase of the plot or the start of construction."

* Step 2: Demand Aggregation
"We aggregate the stated needs and preferences to determine the demand for various types of spaces and features within the prospective building."

* Step 3: Site Analysis & Acquisition
"Based on aggregated demand, we assist in identifying suitable plots and conduct comprehensive analysis to understand the constraints and potentials of the land."

* Step 4: Customization & Design
"Clients can work with experts to customize rooms and features, prioritizing amenities that make the building unique to them, all while keeping the budget in mind."

* Step 5: Visualization & Finalization
"Clients can visualize their spaces from the inside out, ensuring clarity on what will be built. This step allows for any final modifications before the construction begins."

* Step 6: Construction & Quality Assurance
"We collaborate with a network of vetted builders to ensure adherence to quality standards and specifications provided by the clients."

* Step 7: Communication & Project Management
"We act as a single point of contact, streamlining all communications between clients and everyone involved in the building process."

* Step 8: Delivery & Handover
"Once the construction is completed as per the specified requirements, we facilitate the handover process to the clients, ensuring a smooth transition."






### Benefits of Build-on-Demand:
* Client-Centric Approach: Ensures every building is a true reflection of the needs and lifestyles of its occupants.
* Efficient Project Management: Streamlined communication and a single point of contact make the construction process more manageable and efficient.
* Quality Assurance: Collaboration with vetted and specialized builders guarantees high standards in construction quality.
* Cost-Efficiency: Reduced capital costs and optimized resource allocation contribute to substantial cost reductions while maintaining high quality.










#### Core Strategy
**Cost-based Acquisition rate for Limited Partners:** <br>
The Limited Partnership has strategically chosen to sell apartments at a cost base exclusively to real estate funds, rather than to individual investors or to end buyers. This approach allows these funds to acquire assets at a price that presents them as a lucrative investment. By creating a unique clientele of institutional investors, the fund ensures a continuous influx of capital and establishes long-term relationships that can lead to repeat business. This model not only streamlines our sales and marketing efforts but also aligns with our objective of ensuring steady and predictable sales cycles.<br>

**Annualized Return on Investment:** <br>
Limited Partners (LPs) will obtain property assets with considerable appreciation potential. It is projected that LPs will achieve an annualized Return on Investment (ROI) of 20%, calculated from the date of their initial capital contribution to the point of apartment delivery.<br>

**Landmark Building Proposition:** <br>
The objective is to construct a residential tower of notable stature within the city. Subject to regulatory approvals, the development anticipates a structure comprising up to 30 floors, positioning it as a defining element of the city's architectural landscape.<br>

#### Structure: The Limited Partnership
The project is managed under a Limited Partnership (LP) framework, with a General Partner (GP) overseeing the project's execution, management, and strategic decisions. 

#### Capital Contributions & Apartment Allocation:
* LPs: When an LP invests in the project, their capital contribution is directly tied to a pre-determined number of apartments, the cost of which is calculated based on the actual development cost.
* GP: As compensation for the management, oversight, and inherent risks undertaken, the GP will receive entitlement to 25% of all apartments constructed within the tower.

#### Fair apartment split algorithm
The apartment split among LPs is based on their proportionate investment in the project. An algorithm ensures that the split is equitable, considering factors like apartment size, floor level, and view orientation.


### Pricing Mechanism:
The cost of each apartment is pre-determined before the LPs make their capital contribution. This provides clarity and transparency, ensuring that LPs are fully aware of what they receive in return for their investment.
### Maximum Capped Cost
The GP will establish a predetermined maximum budgeted cost per apartment. This cap ensures predictability for the LPs and demonstrates the GP's commitment to cost control and efficiency. Any residual funds post-completion will be proportionally returned to the LPs.

### General Partner Compensation:
General Partner Compensation:
The GP's primary compensation is in the form of real estate equity. Out of the total apartments built, the GP is entitled to 25% as a reward for their management efforts, risks, and expertise brought to the project. This percentage is in line with industry standards, considering the risks and responsibilities undertaken by the GP.


### Investment objectives
* **Purpose and Scope:** Acquire land, design, and develop an iconic high-rise residential building spanning a height of 90-120 meters.
* Deliver to LPs their proportionate share of apartments. They're free to sell or lease these based on their financial strategies.
* Achieve a targeted ROI OF 15%+ per annum compared to market prices of apartments. This ROI is calculated based on current market trends, expected appreciation, and rental yields.





### Proprietary Software Support Platform 
* Enhance the potential for long-term growth through a software platform for the sale and rental of apartments
* Enhance value by Deliver a building management platform enabling tenants to manage their building and service amenities



### Investment Strategies
To achieve its strategies, the Partnership will acquire land in city centers that fall under the building incentives scheme in the Republic of Cyprus. The building incentives scheme offers increased building density height terms and expedited approvals for developments in designated areas, promoting urban development.

### Architecture, Engineering, and Planning Strategies
We target the upscale market delivering outstanding design and engineering
Our architectural design and planning prioritize essential facilities and common spaces, enhancing the living experience. By strategically avoiding superfluous features, we not only reduce development and running expenses but also ensure low management costs. This focused approach allows us to present apartments at competitive prices without sacrificing quality.

### Residential Units Detail Description:**
* The average apartment size is 110 sqm, with individual units varying between 90 to 1700 sqm including outdoor spaces. This size range is based on market research targeting middle to upper-middle-class families and corporate employees
* Each apartment has a 20-30 sqm covered outdoor space. This space is designed to enhance the living experience, providing a relaxation area and potentially increasing the resale value.<br>

### Low building management and maintenance costs

**Amenities:** Furthermore, our approach to amenities and services is streamlined through external collaborations and our proprietary platform, ensuring premium experiences without the overheads.<br>
**Heating and cooling systems:** Specifically tailored to the Cyprus climate, we ensure they are not over-engineered, thereby significantly reducing maintenance and running costs.
<br>

### Custom-made project management platform
We have deployed a unique platform to allow us to manage project communication with all stakeholders effectively and reduce pre-construction times significantly<br>

### Fund Structure:
* Legal Structure:** Limited Partnership
* Limited Partners (LPs):** Institutional external investors who provide the the capital but have limited liability and are not involved in the day-to-day management<br>
* General Partner (GP): The GP is the developer responsible for the day-to-day management of the fund, making investment decisions, and executing the project.<br>

### Roles and Responsibilities of the GP
* Acquisition of Land: Identifying, evaluating, and acquiring suitable land for the project.
* Regulatory Compliance: Ensuring all regulatory requirements are met.
* Co-design the Architecture fo the development, and effectively coordinate Architecture, Engineering, and E/M design
* Project Management: Overseeing the construction and development process.
* Sales: Marketing and selling the developed property to finance the remaining 50% equity.
* Construction Oversight: Ensuring the project is constructed as per the specifications and within the budget.
* Day-to-Day Operations: Managing the daily operations of the project.


### Offering Memorandum: 
The Private Placement Memorandum (PPM) outlines the fund's strategy, terms, risks, and other pertinent details. Interested parties can access the PPM via a dedicated link on our website.

### Pre-Closing Capital Commitments:
The General Partner (GP) will issue a "capital call" for a portion of the committed capital. Capital calls are expected to occur semi-annually, with an average amount equivalent to 17% of the committed capital.

### Expense Allocation:
* Organizational Expenses: These are costs associated with setting up the fund. Expected to be within 2-3% of the total fund size.
* Due Diligence and Pre-Investment Expenses: Costs related to market analysis, site visits, and initial due diligence. Estimated to be around 1-2% of the total fund size.

### Management Fee & Expense Reimbursement:
* Management Fee: The GP usually charges an annual management fee. This fee is set at 2% of the committed or invested capital.
* Expense Reimbursement: Some specific expenses might be directly reimbursed by the fund. Terms of such reimbursements are detailed in the fund's official documents.


### Transition to Investment Phase:
* Closing: Once the preliminary activities are complete and the project is ready to proceed, the fund transitions to the "closing" or "investment" phase. At this point, additional capital is drawn from investors, and the project's active development begins.
* Return of Unused Capital:** If any of the drawn capital remains unused after the pre-investment activities, it can either be returned to investors or offset against future capital calls.


### Exit Strategy
The GP delivers fully operational apartments to the LP's and that concludes the obligations of the GP towards the LPs.

### Risk Mitigation Strategies:
1.0 Construction Management:<br>
1.1 Procurement of Materials: By directly handling the procurement of materials and delivering them to subcontractors, the GP effectively mitigates the risk associated with subcontractor insolvency. This strategy ensures that even if a subcontractor faces financial difficulties, the project won't be stalled due to material shortages. Moreover, by eliminating the middleman, the GP can significantly reduce overhead costs and profits that subcontractors might add to material procurement. This direct control also ensures timely delivery of materials, keeping the project on schedule.<br>

1.2 Acting as the General Contractor: The decision for the GP to act as the general contractor is a strategic one. By being the primary point of responsibility on the construction site, the GP can maintain full control over all activities. This control is crucial, especially in regions where local regulations favor the general contractor in disputes. By being the general contractor, the GP ensures that they aren't held hostage by any other entity in case of disagreements or issues. Furthermore, by assigning all works as subcontracts, the GP can maintain flexibility in choosing specialized teams for different tasks, ensuring quality and efficiency.<br>

1.3 Floorplan Design Flexibility: Introducing a floor-based modular system is an innovative approach to risk mitigation. This system allows the GP to remain agile in the face of changing market demands. If there's a shift in market trends, such as a preference for larger living spaces or additional rooms, the modular system allows for easy modifications to the floor plans. This adaptability ensures that the apartments remain attractive to potential buyers or tenants, maximizing occupancy rates and ROI.<br>

2.0 Market and Economic Risks:<br>

3.0 Regulatory and Legal Risks:<br>
3.1 Zoning and Permit Changes: Local authorities might change zoning laws or permit requirements, affecting the project's viability. Mitigation: Regularly liaising with local authorities and staying updated on potential regulatory changes can help anticipate and adapt to such changes.<br>

3.2 Contractual Disputes: Disagreements with subcontractors, suppliers, or buyers can lead to legal disputes. Mitigation: Clear, comprehensive contracts with dispute resolution clauses and maintaining open communication channels can help prevent or quickly resolve disputes.<br>

4.0 Environmental and Operational Risks:<br>

4.1 Natural Disasters: Events like earthquakes, floods, or hurricanes can damage the property. Mitigation: Investing in disaster-resistant construction methods and securing comprehensive insurance can help protect against such risks.<br>

4.2 Operational Delays: Unforeseen events, like labor strikes or global pandemics, can delay construction. Mitigation: Maintaining a buffer in the project timeline and having contingency plans in place can help manage such delays.<br>
